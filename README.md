# Machine Learning Model Hub

This repository provides implementations of various machine learning models from scratch. Each model is explained in detail with visualizations and usage examples. Additionally, a Flask web app is provided for interactive model predictions.

## Models Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Neural Network

## Usage

### Jupyter Notebooks

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to find detailed explanations and implementations of each model.

### Flask Web App

1. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to interact with the models.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by adding more models, improving existing ones, or enhancing the web app.
